# push_swap

push_swap is a sorting algorithm project from the Hive curriculum that challenges you to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The goal is to implement an efficient algorithm that outputs the minimal sequence of moves required to sort the data.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of push_swap is to sort data on a stack with the least number of operations, using only a predefined set of instructions. This project enhances understanding of algorithm optimization, data structures, and efficient coding practices.

## 📁 Project Structure

### ✅ Mandatory Part

- Implement a program that takes a list of integers and sorts them using only the allowed operations.
- The program should output the sequence of operations used to sort the stack.

## 🔧 Compilation & Usage

The project includes a `Makefile` for easy compilation.

./push_swap 3 2 1

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Implementing and optimizing sorting algorithms.
- Managing data using stacks and understanding their operations.
- Using linked lists on practice.
